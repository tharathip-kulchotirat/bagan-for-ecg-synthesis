According to the article "BAGAN: Data Augmentation with Balancing GAN" by Mariani et al (2018), BAGAN was developed to generate minority-class images.

The proposed BAGAN methodology consists of three training steps: 

1. Pre-training of the autoencoder: The encoder module of an autoencoder is trained to learn an accurate class-conditioning in the latent space.

2. Adversarial training of the generator and discriminator: The generator is initialized with the encoder module of the pre-trained autoencoder, and then adversarially trained with a discriminator to generate high-quality images. During this process, we apply class conditioning in the latent space to drive the generation process towards a target class.

3. Fine-tuning of deep-learning classifiers: The augmented dataset generated by BAGAN is used to fine-tune deep-learning classifiers, resulting in higher accuracy compared to other generative adversarial networks when aiming at the generation of high-quality images starting with an imbalanced training set.
